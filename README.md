# Currencycloud

Powering global payments

# Brief

We want to see if you understand our service and assess your technical know-how.

Review our Developer Centre and any associated documentation on Github then build a basic application showcasing what Currencycloud does.

Be creative! Design and build a basic application against our demo environment using some or all of the following Currencycloud APIs:

   • Conversions
  
   • Payments
  
   • Beneficiaries
  
   • Rates


# Caveats

While this application can perform most of it's intended functions, it is by no means finished. Work is needed on validation and creating beneficiaries. To use the application effectively it is recommended that you use GBP and EUR conversions for the time being.
